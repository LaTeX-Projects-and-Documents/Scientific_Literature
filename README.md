# Scientific_Literature
This is a collection of the scientific literature that I was able to write in LaTeX. This contains my dissertation and my literature review.
As can be seen, there are a number of png files that are required for both reports. However, I was able to program my own images into the document. One of the examples of this is the fibre bundle, the code for which can be seen in isolation in a separate file. 
My dissertation is by far my longest coding file and, at the behest of further flaunting, was given high praise for the way in which it was written.
